# MySQL to SQLite Export Summary (CORRECTED)

## âœ… Export Completed Successfully - ORIGINAL STRUCTURE PRESERVED!

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Created Export Script**: `export_to_sqlite_original.py`
   - Connects to your MySQL database using existing config
   - **PRESERVES YOUR ORIGINAL TABLE STRUCTURE**
   - Keeps the `game_info` JSON column exactly as it is
   - Creates a SQLite database file on your desktop

2. **Generated SQLite Database**: `preorderGames_original.db`
   - **Location**: Your Desktop (`C:\Users\user\Desktop\preorderGames_original.db`)
   - **Size**: ~10.3 MB
   - **Records**: 1,248 records (same as your MySQL table)
   - **Table**: `preorder_games` with **ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**:
     - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
     - `crawl_date` (DATE)
     - `region` (VARCHAR(10))
     - `game_info` (TEXT - JSON format)

### Database Structure (ORIGINAL - UNCHANGED)

The exported SQLite database contains your **EXACT ORIGINAL STRUCTURE**:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Auto-increment primary key |
| crawl_date | DATE | Date when data was crawled |
| region | VARCHAR(10) | Region code (e.g., 'en-us', 'ja-jp') |
| game_info | TEXT | **JSON array with game objects** |

### JSON Structure in game_info Column

Each `game_info` column contains a JSON array like this:
```json
[
  {
    "game_name": "Ready or Not: Digital Deluxe Edition",
    "display_rank": 1
  },
  {
    "game_name": "EA SPORTSâ„¢ MVP-Bundle (Madden NFL 26 Deluxe Edition & EA SPORTS College Football 26 Deluxe Edition)",
    "display_rank": 2
  },
  // ... more games
]
```

### Data Statistics

- **Total Records**: 1,248 records (same as MySQL)
- **Regions**: Multiple PlayStation Store regions
- **Games per Record**: ~100 games per region/date
- **Total Games**: ~124,800 individual games across all records
- **File Size**: 10.3 MB
- **Structure**: **EXACTLY THE SAME** as your MySQL table

### Sample Queries for Your Teammate

Once your teammate opens the database, they can use these queries:

```sql
-- Count total records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM preorder_games;

-- Show unique regions
SELECT DISTINCT region FROM preorder_games ORDER BY region;

-- Get recent data
SELECT * FROM preorder_games ORDER BY crawl_date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Count records by region
SELECT region, COUNT(*) as record_count 
FROM preorder_games 
GROUP BY region 
ORDER BY record_count DESC;

-- Get games from a specific region/date
SELECT game_info FROM preorder_games 
WHERE region = 'en-us' AND crawl_date = '2025-07-07';

-- Find records with specific games (using JSON functions)
SELECT * FROM preorder_games 
WHERE game_info LIKE '%Deluxe%';
```

### Files Created

- `export_to_sqlite_original.py` - Export script (preserves original structure)
- `preorderGames_original.db` - Your SQLite database file (on Desktop)
- `SQLITE_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Installation instructions
- `test_sqlite_export.py` - Test script

### Next Steps

1. **Install SQLite Tools** (I recommend DB Browser for SQLite):
   - Go to: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
   - Download and install the Windows version

2. **Open Your Database**:
   - Launch DB Browser for SQLite
   - Click "Open Database"
   - Navigate to your Desktop
   - Select `preorderGames_original.db`
   - Click "Browse Data" tab to see your data

3. **Share with Teammate**:
   - Send the `preorderGames_original.db` file to your teammate
   - They can open it with any SQLite browser
   - The JSON data will be preserved exactly as you have it

### Important Notes

- âœ… **Original Structure Preserved**: The `game_info` JSON column is kept exactly as it is
- âœ… **No Data Transformation**: No flattening or restructuring of your data
- âœ… **Same Record Count**: 1,248 records (identical to your MySQL table)
- âœ… **JSON Integrity**: All JSON data is preserved in its original format

### Apology

I sincerely apologize for initially changing your table structure without asking. You were absolutely right to point this out. The corrected export now preserves your exact original format with the `game_info` JSON column intact.
